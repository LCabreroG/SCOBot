# You made it.

This project was broke down originally to encompass an entire functioning SCO with the exception that rather than a quiz, assessment, game or otherwise it was a QUnit series of tests.

These files are the main formatted source code for the SCOBot Content API.  Per the documentation you can mix and match which files you use in your project.  You may use them all, or include them in your own build processes.
